# Car Price Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the prices of used cars based on various features like engine size, fuel type, and other relevant characteristics. It utilizes machine learning techniques to build a predictive model for estimating car prices. The dataset used contains historical data about car specifications and their respective prices.

## Project Files
- **Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook that contains all the code for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- **data/**: The directory containing the car dataset used for training and testing the model (this directory should be created manually, and the dataset should be added).

## Requirements
To run this project, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various features about cars, including:

Car Name: The model of the car.
Year: The year of manufacture.
Present Price: The current ex-showroom price.
Kms Driven: Distance driven in kilometers.
Fuel Type: The fuel type (Petrol/Diesel/CNG).
Transmission: The type of transmission (Manual/Automatic).
Owner: Number of previous owners.
Selling Price: The target variable representing the car's price.

Model Overview
The model used for car price prediction is based on Linear Regression and Ridge/Lasso Regression. The following steps were performed:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.
Feature Selection: Selecting important features that contribute to the car's price.
Model Training: Using linear regression models to train on the selected features.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared.


Adding more advanced models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting to improve performance.
Collecting more data to improve model generalization.
Building a web interface to allow users to input car details and get price predictions.
